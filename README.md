### Developer Profile

#### Languages

Here is my current skillset. I like to code using Jupyter Notebooks through Visual Studio Code.

| Language             | Skill Level | Note                                                                                          |
| -------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Python**           | Proficient  | My strongest language, I've been coding in Python since 2016.                                 |
| **Julia**            | Improving   | I'm working through some tutorials and making a few demo projects.                            |
| **R**                | Improving   | I've used R before, but I would like to understand the language a bit better.                 |
| **Bash**             | Proficient  | Not really a language per se, but I am experienced with a terminal.                           |
| **SQL**              | Proficient  | I used Transact SQL (T-SQL) extensively during my time as a full-stack developer.             |

You can view my [Python tech stack](https://rentry.co/python-tech-stack) to see what packages I use or am currently learning.

#### Interests

Most of my research and professional endeavours are documented elsewhere (ResearchGate, LinkedIn).<br />
For now, I'll fill this space with some fun stuff! Since everywhere else is rather academic, right?

So, any interests independent of my work?<br />
I'm a compulsive learner - I really 💚 learning - there isn't much that doesn't pique my curiousity!<br />

* **Reading**📚 - I'll read just about anything. No, seriously. I love reading!<br />
  Scientific literature, dystopian novels, Tolkienesque fantasy, and shoujo manga are my sweet spot!
* **Languages**💬 - Language fascinates me. I'm currently learning Japanese (日本語) and Norwegian (norsk).<br />
  I plan to learn Traditional / Simplified Chinese (中文) and Spanish (española) sometime in the future.
* **Technology**🖥️ - I'm a technologist and love to build computers. Take a peek at my current [PC specs](https://rentry.co/computer-specs).<br />
  I also love breadboarding embedded systems with Arduino and Raspberry Pi microcontrollers!
* **Complementary Medicines**🌿 - I'm very interested in this area! Aromatherapy, reflexology, PEMF therapy,<br /> 
  photobiomodulation, neurostimulation, and nutritional biochemistry including probiotics and the gut microbiota.

#### Projects & Licensing

Nowadays, most of my hobbyist and portfolio projects are published on Kaggle for educational purposes.<br />
GitHub is where I host code repositories pertaining to research papers, software libraries, and open datasets.

These are usually provided under the MIT license, and I encourage forking and reproducing experiments!<br />
There is however the exception of any datasets; please check the individual repo license in those cases.

I don't always use my own data; a number of researchers publish open data on GitHub, and I encourage you to take a look.<br />
I have an ever-expanding list of validated open data from researchers; see my 'Dataset' list under my starred✨ repos.

Whether you use my data or theirs, I respectfully ask that credit be given through appropriate citation. Thanks!
